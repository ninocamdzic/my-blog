# My Blog

# Running

The blog needs to run on a web-server. A simple web-server we can use is [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

1. Run `npx http-server` in the root folder of the project. Example: If the blog is located in /projects then that's where you should run `npx http-server`. You can then navigate with your browser to blog.
2. Now open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and navigate to the project folder.
